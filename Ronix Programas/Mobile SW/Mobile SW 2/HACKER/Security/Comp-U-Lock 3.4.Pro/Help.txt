   i.  ScheduleIt! 2000 Express is an integrated software which comes with Comp-U-Lock.  It will schedule many things for you, which is what makes Comp-U-Lock one of the most powerful and popular security programs in the world.

   ii.  When you schedule a Comp-U-Lock, you may specify the day, time, and frequency.  You may schedule a lock everyday, just for one day, or on selected days of the week.

   iii.  When you schedule a shut down or restart, your computer will automatically perform that specific action at the specified days and time.  You may choose to have Comp-U-Lock give you a 60-second warning prior to restarting or shutting down.

   iv.  Scheduled tasks allow you to run specific programs prior to automatically locking your computer.  These tasks will only be performed when your computer is automatically locked, not instantly locked.


e.
   i. EnKryptor Deluxe is an add-on for Comp-U-Lock.  It allows the user to specify up to 999 files in which to encrypt (disable) while your computer is locked.  This is meant to be useful for computer on a network, where other computers may have access to your hard disk.  Again, this option should be used for those who have a network or share hard disks.

   ii. The benefits of EnKryptor far outnumbers the amount of space to discuss it here.  It simply encrypts files so people can't access that specific file, no matter where they access it from.


|(3)|

a.	Unlocking your computer requires a password.  This can be either the administrative or user password.  Unlocking will restore your original screen resolution, decrypt all files, and restore all Windows functions.

	Logging on to Windows using Comp-U-Lock will restore the Windows desktop, Start Menu, and task switching.  This will only take effect if either the administrative or user password is enter.

b.	To ensure maximum security, you should enable both logging on and auto-start locking.


|(4)|

	To make sure you are using Comp-U-Lock most effectively, follow these guidelines:

   1. Do not force a resolution unless it is absolutely necessary.
   2. Do not use a background on slower computers.
   3. Do not enable marquee on slower computers.
   4. Disable shut down / restart menu on slower computers.
   5. Use Speed Shut Downs / Restarts instead of Windows functions.
   6. Check for updates weekly.
