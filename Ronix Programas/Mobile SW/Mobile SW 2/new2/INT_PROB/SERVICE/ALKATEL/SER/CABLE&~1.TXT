How to build cable: 
The usual MAX232 schematic with external power supply thru an 7805.
You use Gnd, Txd and Rxd line from serial port (com). On the phone connector you have 
this connection (holding phone with keypad up, bottom view, from left to right counting)
pin 1-4-9-GND
pin 11 thru MAX232 to COM's Txd
pin 12 thru MAX232 to COM's Rxd
Built it, it works.

Now the software:
It is the original Alcatel service software copied directly from an
hard-disk where it was installed, so you must copy all by yourself. Not all
the software options are working, but it unlocks all HD1 alcatel phones
(OTE, OTClub).

1. EXTRACT all files in ROOT directory of drive C:
You will get 4 new drectories
2. Copy the dll files you find in RETROFIT\FTPV706\EXE to WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory
3. Insert this in your win.ini file
[CVIRT4]
CVIRT4=C:\CVI\CVIRT4.EXE
4. Start the application LGTHD1R2.EXE in the directory from point2
The program must start. Configure from option menu the language English,
from the first menu from left the com port

Connect the phone switched off.
Also from first menu choose SWITCH ON and then CONECTING.
Don't care if you get some error messages on some phones.
Use the EEPROM READ/WITE by KEYBOARD commands you find to chage locations
176, 177 to FF, using Ctrl+Enter for read/write command in the menu's.

That's it
