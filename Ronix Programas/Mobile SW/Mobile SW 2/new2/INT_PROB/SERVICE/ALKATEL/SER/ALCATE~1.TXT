How to build cable: 
The usual MAX232 schematic with external power supply thru an 7805.
You use Gnd, Txd and Rxd line from serial port (com). On the phone connector you have 
this connection (holding phone with keypad up, bottom view, from left to right counting)
pin 1-4-9-GND
pin 11 thru MAX232 to COM's Txd
pin 12 thru MAX232 to COM's Rxd
Built it, it works.
