This is an easy-to-use simulator for the new Scenix microcontroller,
which is a superset of the PIC16C5x.

For a quick idea of what it does, run the DEMO batch file then hit the
spacebar a few times or hit F6.

For a better idea of what it does, hit F1 to see the help screen.

As a last resort try reading SXSIM.DOC.
