2.1 The Diskettes

Soft-ICE comes on either a 5 1/4" diskette or a 3 1/2" diskette.

When you run Soft-ICE, the name of the person that your copy of Soft-ICE
is licensed to is displayed on the screen as a deterrent to software
pirates. The Soft-ICE diskette is not physically copy-protected for your
convenience. For our convenience, we appreciate your high regard for our
licensing agreement. It is important to make a duplicate copy to be used
only for backup in case the original diskette is damaged.

A directory of a Soft-ICE diskette will show the following files:
   S-ICE.EXE
   S-ICE.DAT
   LDR.EXE
   MSYM.EXE
   EMMSETUP.EXE
   UPTIME.EXE
   README.SI
   SAMPLE.EXE
   SAMPLE.ASM
   SAMPLE.SYM

S-ICE.EXE is the Soft-ICE program.
S-ICE.DAT is the Soft-ICE initialization file.
LDR.EXE is the Soft-ICE program and symbol file loader.
MSYM.EXE is the Soft-ICE symbol file creation program.
EMMSETUP.EXE is a program that allows you to customize the way your system
will use expanded memory.
UPTIME.EXE sets the time to that of the real time clock.

     8

README.SI is a text file containing information about Soft-ICE that did
not make it into this manual.
SAMPLE.EXE is a short demonstration program that is used with the
tutorial.
SAMPLE.ASM is the assembly language source file for the demonstration
program.
SAMPLE.SYM is the symbol file for the demonstration program.

2.2 Loading Soft-ICE

Before running Soft-ICE, copy all of the files on the distribution
diskette to your hard disk.

These files should be placed in a directory that is accessible through
your alternate path list.

S-ICE.EXE can be loaded as a device driver in CONFIG.SYS or can be run as
a program from the command line. To use many of Soft-ICE's features, S-
ICE.EXE must be loaded as a device driver in CONFIG.SYS.

Note :
If you do not have extended memory, Soft-ICE can NOT loaded as a device
driver. Instead, it must be run from the DOS prompt.

2.2.1 Loading Without Extended Memory

When no extended memory is present, Soft-ICE loads it at the highest
memory location possible. The memory used by Soft-ICE is then 'mapped
out', making it invisible to DOS programs. Since the total memory visible
to DOS its programs is less after Soft-ICE loads, it is recommended

     9

that you load Soft-ICE before any TSR's or control programs.
If you do not have extended memory, simply enter:

    S-ICE

2.2.2 Loading With Extended Memory

Loading Soft-ICE with extended memory can be done in one of two ways:
  1. Install S-ICE,EXE as a driver in CONFIG,SYS,
      This method is necessary if you will be using one
      the following capabilities:
      * Sharing memory with programs that use
         extended memory by using ROM BIOS calls
         (VDISK,SYS, RAMDRIVE.SYS,
         HIMEM.SYS, cache programs, etc.).
      * Using Soft-ICE's EMM 4,0 capability,
      * Using Soft-ICE for symbolic or source level
          debugging.
      * Using back trace ranges.
      * Using Soft-ICE with other Nu-Mega products
          such as MagicCV,
      When loaded as a driver, Soft-ICE allocates a
      portion of extended memory for itself and its
      associated components so there can be no memory
      conflicts. S-ICE.EXE must be loaded in
      CONFIG.SYS before any other driver that
      allocates extended memory is loaded (e.g.,
      VDISK.SYS, RAMDRIVE.SYS). Generally
      Soft-ICE works best if it is the first loadable device
      driver installed in CONFIG.SYS.

     10

      For users that are new to Soft-ICE it is advisable to
      load Soft-ICE as the first driver in CONFIG.SYS
      with the following statement:

    device = drive: \path\S-ICE.EXE /SYM 50

      Drive and path specify the directory where
      S-ICE.EXE is located. This statement will load
      Soft-ICE at system initialization and will be
      adequate for the tutorial. However, Soft-ICE will
      not be installed for some of its more powerful
      features such as EMM 4.0. You can reconfigure
      Soft-ICE with those features enabled after you
      have experimented a bit. If you already have
      experience with Soft-ICE or would like to set up
      Soft-ICE with those features immediately, please
      read chapter 6 (Soft-ICE Initialization Options).

Caution:
When installing any new device driver for the first time on your system,
it is advisable to have a boot diskette available This precautionary
measure is for the unlikely event that The default setup of the device
driver is not compatible with your system.

      If you are not sure how to edit your CONFIG.SYS
      file, refer to your system user's guide or your text
      editor user's guide for instructions. After you have
      modified your CONFIG.SYS file, you must reboot
      your system to have the changes take effect.

   2. Run Soft-ICE from the DOS Prompt by typing
      S-ICE. Before actually loading, Soft-ICE will
      display a loading message and prompt. To prevent
      this prompt, place the word EXTENDED in the
      S-ICE.DAT file. See section 6.4 for more
      information on the S-ICE.DAT file. Using this

     11

     method, S-ICE.EXE is automatically loaded into
     the top of extended memory, whether or not
     anything else is already there. If you know you will
     not have any other programs using extended
     memory, this method is acceptable. When loaded
     with this method, Soft-ICE occupies ZERO bytes
     of conventional memory. The command you use is:
     
  S-ICE

Notes:
You can NOT enable all of Soft-ICE's features when Loading from the
command line. If you will be using Soft-ICE as a stand-alone debugger, it
is recommended to Load Soft-ICE from CONFIG.SYS.

If you want to load Soft-ICE as a device driver, but don't want Soft-ICE
to be resident all of the time, you should use the /UN loading switch.
Refer to section 6.3.1 for more information.

 2.2.3 Configuring Soft-ICE for a Customized Installation

You can customize Soft-ICE with Soft-ICE loading switches in CONFIG.SYS
and with the Soft-ICE initialization file S-ICE.DAT. The CONFIG.SYS
loading switches allow you to customize how the extended memory will be
reserved by Soft-ICE. The initialization file S-ICE.DAT allows you to
specify configuration options, assign commands to function keys, and
define an auto-start string. An auto-start string is used to execute a
series of commands that you use every time you install Soft-ICE. for more
information about customizing Soft-ICE, refer to chapter 6.

     12

 2.3 Unloading Soft-ICE

Occasionally you may need to unload Soft-ICE. A typical reason for
unloading Soft-ICE is to run a program that uses 80286 or 80386 protected
mode instructions. To unload Soft-ICE, enter:

  S-ICE /U

This command places the machine back in real address mode. If Soft-ICE was
initially loaded from CONFIG.SYS When the memory is still reserved for
Soft-ICE and can not be used by other software. If Soft-ICE was initially
loaded from the command line, unloading frees up the memory consumed by S-
ICE.EXE.

Caution:
If you have any backfilled memory in your system, or if expanded memory is
currently being used, unloading Soft-ICE could crash your system.

 2.4 Reloading Soft-ICE

Soft-ICE can be re-loaded at any time even if it had initially been loaded
in CONFIG.SYS. If Soft-ICE had initially  been loaded in CONFIG.SYS then
the original configuration options (EMM 4.0, symbols and source...) are
still in effect. To reload Soft-ICE, enter:

  S-ICE
