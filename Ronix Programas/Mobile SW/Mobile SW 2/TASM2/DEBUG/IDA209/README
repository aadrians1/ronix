Version 2.09 from 20-Sep-94

   IDA  stands  for  Interactive   DisAssembler.   Unlike   many   other
disassemblers, IDA works together with you, allowing you to  modify  the
disassembled text 'on the fly'. It  supports  many  processors,  various
input file formats, can produce various output files e t.c.  IDA  has  a
built-in C-like language and sports TVision user interface. This version
of IDA works ONLY on 386 or higher!!!
