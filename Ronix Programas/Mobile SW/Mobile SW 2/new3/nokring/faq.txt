          In order to transfer a new ringing tone composed with Nokring to your phone,
          you need to upload tone to your phone and send tone as a special short message
          via Short Message Service Centre (SMSC) back to your phone:
                      nokring --> phone --> SMSC --> phone

          You can transfer tone to phone and request your phone to send it as special
          short message to any mobile number automatically in Nokring by selecting:
                      Send / Send ringing tone to phone / Enter Mobile number / Upload

          later by manually using phone's forward short message feature. You can find
          saved ringing tones in your SIM card's memory by reading short messages.
          Ringing tone message is that one which cannot be displayed. This message
          can be forwarded by selecting in your phone:
                      Option / Forward / Enter Number / Ok .

What programs and hardware are needed to transfer tones to phone?

          - Uploading ringing tones to phone requires Nokring and a GSM 07.05 PDU compatible
              software or hardware installed in your PC, for example one of the following:
                  * Nokia Data Suite 1.0 (software) + Nokia 3110, 8110, 8110i and compatible phone
                  * Nokid Data Suite 1.2 (software) + Nokia 5110, 6110, 6150 and compatible phone
                  * Nokia Data Suite 2.0 (software) + Nokia 5110, 6110, 6150 and compatible phone
                  * Nokia Data Card (hardware) + Nokia 2110, 2110i and compatible phone
                  * Nokia Card Phone (hardware)
          - Network Service for sending and receiving short messages
          - Message Centre Number for SMSC, which supports 8 bit data and user data headers
              from Mobile to Mobile short message sending.

          If you do not know what is your Message Centre Number, ask it from your network
          service provider's help desk (= your GSM operator).

          Note: You do not need to have Nokia Data Suite sowtware with Nokia 8810 phone,
                   Nokia Card Phone or Nokia Data Card.

How to setup correct communication port for uploading tones in Nokring?

          With Data Suite check from your Control Panel / System / Device Manager,
          which COM port has been assigned by "Nokia GSM Data-Fax Port" or similar.
          Close Data Suite Monitor before uploading.

          With 8810 phone check from Control Panel / Infrared / Options, which COM
          port provides application support.

          You can verify that your communication port is correct for example with
          Windows HyperTerminal program. Connect phone to your PC, start
          HyperTerminal and select COM port. Write command AT and
          press Enter. If you receive "OK", the selected COM port is correct.

Is it possible to upload tones via infrared with Nokring?

          Yes - It is possible to upload tones to phone via infrared connection:
              * 6110, 6150 and compatible phone + Data Suite + Infrared port in PC
              * 8810 + Infrared port in PC

          If you are using Data Suite, disable Microsoft's Infrared Monitor.
          If you are using 8810 phone, enable Microsoft's Infrared Monitor.

          Start Infrared reception in phone before uploading.

How do I check that does my Short Message Service Centre support 8 bit
short messages and user data headers?

          With Nokia 6110, 6150, 8810 and compatible phone you can check if your SMSC
          allows 8 bit messages and user data headers:

              - Send yourself a Caller Group logo/graphic from your phone
              - If you can receive it and view it, the Message Centre Number is OK.

I received a short message and my phone (6110, 6150, 8110i, 8810) says that
"MESSAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED HERE" ?

          Your Short Message Service Centre does not support so called 8 bit short messages
          or short message user data headers. Ask your operator, do they have
          different Message Centre Number for such Short Message Service Centre,
          which supports 8 bit and user data headers.

          If they don't have such Service Centre, it is time to change operator...

What is Ringing Tones Text Transfer Language (RTTTL) ?

          This "RTTTL" language is used for publishing ringing tones for example in web pages.
