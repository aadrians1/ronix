  €∞ Welcome to HDD Regenerator - the unique software program for          ∞€
  €∞ regeneration of hard disk drives. The program eliminates physical     ∞€
  €∞ damages (bad sectors) from hard disk drive surface. It does not hide  ∞€
  €∞ bad sectors, it really restores them!                                 ∞€
  €∞                                                                       ∞€

  €∞ How it works...                                                       ∞€
  €∞                                                                       ∞€
  €∞ Almost 60 % of all damaged by bad sectors hard drives have            ∞€
  €∞ incorrectly magnetized disk surface. Our researches have been         ∞€
  €∞ fruitful and we have found algorithm which is special sequence of     ∞€
  €∞ high and low level signals. These signals are generated by the        ∞€
  €∞ software and they switch damaged surface. Even low level formatting   ∞€
  €∞ is not able to handle this task!                                      ∞€
  €∞                                                                       ∞€

  €∞ Main benefits of HDD Regenerator...                                   ∞€
  €∞                                                                       ∞€
  €∞ HDD Regenerator regenerates bad sectors by magnetic reversal. If your ∞€
  €∞ hard drive is damaged by bad sectors, the disk not only becomes unfit ∞€
  €∞ for use, but also you risk losing information stored on the disk. HDD ∞€
  €∞ Regenerator will regenerate your hard disk (almost 60 % of damaged    ∞€
  €∞ hard disks are subject to regeneration). As a result, not readable    ∞€
  €∞ damaged information will be restored. With all this going on the      ∞€
  €∞ existing information will not be affected!                            ∞€
  €∞                                                                       ∞€

 €∞ After more than 4 years of nonstop releasing we are proud to present  ∞€
 €∞ you our 6000th 0day release, thus being only the second group ever    ∞€
 €∞ to reach this barrier. From the day BLiZZARD was formed in february   ∞€
 €∞ 1998 we have always been on the very top of the release rankings and  ∞€
 €∞ unlike many other groups we have almost never had any periods of      ∞€
 €∞ idleness or relaxation.                                               ∞€
 €∞ Over the years many friends joined us and we have grown to become     ∞€ 
 €∞ one of the biggest groups on the scene. New sections were created     ∞€
 €∞ (mp3/iso/pda) and all of them have been a great enrichment            ∞€
 €∞ for all of us, however unity and friendship have always remained,     ∞€
 €∞ even during times of upheaval and depression. All parts of BLiZZARD   ∞€
 €∞ work together with great enthusiasm and harmony. The spirit of a big  ∞€
 €∞ family has never vanished and has always given us a very unique       ∞€
 €∞ character.                                                            ∞€
 €∞ Although we have always appreciated being one of the most active      ∞€
 €∞ release groups our primary concern has never been to rule the scene   ∞€
 €∞ but to spend a very nice time of our lives along with many good       ∞€
 €∞ friends. Friendship and fun will always be our most valuable          ∞€
 €∞ principles and according to them we will act. Over the years we have  ∞€
 €∞ neither been involved in any groupflames nor have we offended other   ∞€
 €∞ scene people without reason. Unlike many other groups we do not       ∞€
 €∞ believe in silly and childish flames, we treat our competitors        ∞€
 €∞ equal, however we want to give special props to the many old-school   ∞€
 €∞ groups which are still active and have survived all the recent busts  ∞€
 €∞ and problems.                                                         ∞€
 €∞ Furthermore BLiZZARD has always offered its members a unique          ∞€
 €∞ atmosphere plus many benefits when it comes to release conditions.    ∞€
 €∞ We have shown the scene that you can be on the top without putting    ∞€
 €∞ your members under pressure, we simply believe in equality and        ∞€
 €∞ friendship. And, of course, many friendships, which go far beyond the ∞€
 €∞ simple cracking business, have been formed. Every BLiZZARD member     ∞€
 €∞ will tell you what a great feeling and honour it is to be a part of   ∞€
 €∞ our family. It is such a great and motivating feeling to play a part  ∞€
 €∞ in it.                                                                ∞€
 €∞ For the future we have already set many targets and we will reach     ∞€
 €∞ them for sure, expect many suprises from us.                          ∞€
 €∞ BLiZZARD will never die, see you soon at the 7000th release :)        ∞€
