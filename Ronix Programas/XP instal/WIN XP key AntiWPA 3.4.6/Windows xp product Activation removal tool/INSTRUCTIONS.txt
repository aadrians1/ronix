How to use the XP Activation Removal Tool:-

Click WPA_Kill.exe to launch. Windows will report that some files have been replaced 
by unrecogised ones and prompt you to restore the Windows files. 
Don't! Leave the unrecognised ones on your PC. Reboot and your done. 

All Windows functionality will continue as normal including 
Windows updates.

If you install SP2 you may have to apply the patch again.
hsi si the latest addition and has been tested on SP1 + sP2, and all seems to be
well. The older tools are in the Other Removal Tools Folder, as well as keygens,
key viewers and other useful utilities.

Recommended WPA-Kill. If you for some reason this does not work, then next to try is 
reset 5.02 in the other tools folder.
